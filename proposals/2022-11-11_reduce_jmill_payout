Proposal date:
11 November 2022

Motivation
I feel that I have not been leading any initiatives at Peel as of late, and that there is not enough work for me to do to justify a full-time salary for myself.

I am also going to be quite busy with several other projects during the fall and winter and intend to dedicate more time to those things.

Rationale
I feel I was a strong contributor while I was working on veNFT and the Settings Page, but as of late I feel my contributions have not been as valuable and that I do not have a major project to lead.

I had been trying to do the DB and user session stuff, but it didn't feel like something that would make or break the JBM app and also felt slightly out of my technicaly ability.

I would still like to contribute, but in a capacity more similar to Ben and Blaz, picking up miscellaneous issues and improvements. The extra money per FC can be allocated as the DAO sees fit.

Additionally, I would still like to be a multisig signer, and retain the ability to invalidate this proposal with a new one should the condititions arise where it makes sense for me to be a fulltime IC again.

Specification
Reduce jmill payout to $1,200 per FC with option to submit a new proposal should contiditions arise where it makes sense for jmill to be an IC again.

jmill will document and handoff all work in progress on things like user verification & sessions, project bookmarking, and twitter verification.
