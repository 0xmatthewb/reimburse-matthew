## Proposal Date

June 08, 2022

## What

Increase my recurring payout from US$3000 to US$4500 in ETH per week.

## Why

### Increased codebase responsibilities

My responsibilities have increased significantly since making my original $3000 proposal. To start with, I have taken on reviewing and merging a great deal of code, while producing the same or a greater amount of dev work myself.

### Increased design role

I have lead the design and development effort of significant UI changes, such as the new payouts/distribution limit system (https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/924).

### Increased community role

I have also taken on a role communicating between Peel, the JB community and new projects. I’ve started the onboarding process and taken part in various onboarding calls (MoonMars, Helios, Nifty Music), formulating new designs including the aforementioned payouts system. I’ve also attended 2 conferences with the aim of gathering customer feedback and helping us get to project market fit, which I’ve summarised in the Strategy thread (https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/973802723420028958/980925534227816468). As a result, I realised the need for building simpler create flow templates, which is something I’m keen to take on straight away.

Also through these community outreach efforts, I identified issues within the community, such as everyone using different terminology. I addressed this with this blog post (https://juicebox.notion.site/V2-Juicebox-key-changes-fd8273e617684dfc887c6bffefb1763d), summarising the recent key terminology changes in the juicebox.money frontend (mostly V2-related).
