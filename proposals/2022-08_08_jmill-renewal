# 2022-06-02 Peri Recurring Payout Renewal

## Reflection

Over the past 10 funding cycles, my core responsibilities have been:
- Implementing the veNFT frontend and subraph functionality
- NextJS Migration Efforts (web APIs and API routes)

Some things I've done:
- Implemented all veNFT functionality, including the user-focused staking screen and the owner-focused veNFT builder UI and enable-for-project tools
- Coordinated folks on JB contract and product side to make changes as necessary to accomodate veNFT frontend workflows
- Implemented web API safety and API routes for our nextJS migrations
- Improvements to codebase robustness such as public gateway fallbacks for IPFS
- A couple dozen other small-mid size tickets/UI improvements not associated with major features

## Proposal

Increase recurring payout from **US$3,000/FC** to **US$4,000/FC**. Renew payout for 12 weeks (aligning with Peel's payout)

## Rationale

Aligning my payout with Wraeth's, reflecting several months of commitment to the team plus increased codebase knowledge and responsibility.

### Responsibilities

Going forward, I will be responsible for the following:

- Continued work on veNFTs, which will involve:
  - Working with JB product team to get stock veBanny live on mainnet for JB project
  - Working with JB product and contract team to figure out how we can add flexible veNFT contracts for any project
  - UX enhancements
  - Documentation and real-world usecases
  - Subgraph enhancements

I will also own other major features in the meantime. I would love to take charge on either versioning UI or multi-terminals UI, both of which are major roadmap items in the coming months. Will also be helping on product page/project creation page flow redesign, and helping for strategy in designing the JB simplified frontends.

A major greenfield idea of mine is to even have a marketplace/app store style frontend that makes it easy to launch and configure any frontend extensions (ticketing, non-profit Donorbox-style, NFT membership, etc) that we build on the JB protocol.
