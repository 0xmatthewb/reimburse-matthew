### **Proposal date:**

17 October 2022

### **Motivation**

Being surrounded by all of you Peel folks feels amazing. You are helping me in sharpening both my coding and leadership talents.

I've enjoyed working on everything over the past ~ 2 months, from JBM to JB High and Defifa, so I strongly believe that JBMs future is only bright.
I'm looking forward to assisting you in pursuing an even brighter future!

### **Rationale**

I dedicated the most of the previous time working on JBMs smaller and medium issues.
I was getting control of the issues that were given to me and taking initiative to identify additional issues or modify the existing code.

Over the last ~2.5 FCs i was mostly preoccupied with JB High and Defifa.

In order to make it clearer to Peel DAO what benefits Peel DAO, I believe it is time that I restructure my proposal.
As a Peel member for the upcoming period, I'd want to suggest the work listed below:

- I will continue to work on small / medium issues with the increased rhythm if needed.
- I believe that i showed initiative in creating new issues and delivering them, i'd like to continue to do so ( there were some very good issues that me and johnnyD found when i was working on https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/2043 )

### **Extra**

This shouldn't have an impact on the proposal, just want to express my gratitude for being given the chance to lead Defifa on behalf of Peel DAO.

### **Specification**

Provide $1000 USD in ETH per funding cycle as compensation to 0xa13d49fCbf79EAF6A0a58cBDD3361422DB4eAfF1 for 10 funding cycles in return for work mentioned above.
