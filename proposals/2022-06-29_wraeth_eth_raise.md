# 2022-05-12 Wraeth Recurring

## Proposal Date

June 29, 2022

## What

Compensate wraeth.eth US4,000 (in ETH) per funding cycle for frontend
development on Peel. This is the same rate I am currently paid ($100USD/hour),
just adjusted for a 40 hour week.

**Time expectation**: 40 hours of effort.

## Why

I have increased capacity to now work on Juicebox at a full time pace (40hrs). A
list of all my commits for the past can be seen here:

**or**

Closed issues with PR:

I also wouldn't mind helping out more with general project structure, future
planning, and helping drive decision making in Peel to greatly improve the
product. I feel that this would also help the team by sharing a bit of this
load.

## Closing

I am loving working with the Peel team on Juicebox! Such a great work
environment and really excited to see where we can take this thing!
