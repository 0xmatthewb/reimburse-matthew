PROPOSAL (edited)  @Peeler (core team)  Hey y'all, with these new rules in place it seems I've come to the limit of my recurring payout (10 cycles), so am proposing a renewal of my US$3k per funding cycle (week) payout. 

Case
- My responsibilities have stepped up since my last proposal. I'm reviewing code and consistently merging it into production. 
- I've maintained my own dev workload in the form of building (with @aeolian) the interface to support the V2 contracts (V2 create /  V2 project page).

I love working with this project and team, and nothing gets me more excited than seeing us continually make incremental improvements to the underlying JB product. Thank you for your consideration and, of course, would greatly appreciate any feedback on this proposal or my work in general
