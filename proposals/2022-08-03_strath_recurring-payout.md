## Proposal date:

August 3rd 2022

## Thesis

I am proposing that I enter a recurring payout of USD$2200 in ETH per funding cycle as a UX/UI Designer working with the Peel core team to take the Juicebox front end and overall user experience to the next level. Time expectation of around 25-30+ hours of effort per week (with availability to scale up during crucial sprints or projects).

## Motivation

Juicebox is currently in a unique situation — we have an amazing product, a strong community and a dedicated team. We are ready to solidify our name in the market and become the go-to platform for emerging DAOs and Web3 crowdfunding. I believe having a dedicated User Experience and Interface designer within the Peel team will allow us to focus on what is most important and impactful to our core users and leverage human-centred design to create a meaningful experience and beautiful UI.

## Specification

Provide $2200USD in ETH per funding cycle as compensation to strathmckay.eth for 10 funding cycles in return for solid UX and Visual Design.

## Rationale

During my trial period, I contributed to the Juicebox product in a number of ways through design, research & strategy. A few examples include:

- UX & UI design of the NFT rewards delivering high-fidelity prototypes —

- Simplifying the design of the Token form —

- Tracking and analysing user behaviour across the site using heat maps and recordings to gain an understanding of how people were using the product and where they were getting stuck or confused.
- Analysing the product through the lens of a user and creating a breakdown of key areas of focus.
- Synthesizing this data and delivering it as a presentation outlining key UX findings, areas that need improvement and proposed solutions organised by priority based on user impact and feasibility. 
This presentation can be found here — [https://www.notion.so/juicebox/UX-Findings-Proposal-2-August-2022-2ee1398d7f884d9c958384cb0d2366aa](https://www.notion.so/UX-Findings-Proposal-2-August-2022-2ee1398d7f884d9c958384cb0d2366aa)

In the above mentioned UX presentation, I delivered a basic roadmap outlining key priorities based on user data and heuristic analysis. After our recent standup discussion, we came to the unanimous decision to focus on redesigning the Project Creation flow as the first point of action. I would like to begin work on this roadmap immediately with intention to deliver the following:

- Redesign of Project Creation flow — including restructuring information architecture, wireframing and delivering high fidelity prototypes. Plus, user testing before and after code deployment to ensure a seamless experience.
- Completely optimise the site for mobile (mobile traffic makes up close to 40% of our user base).
- Redesign the Project Page based on user data and feedback to build more trust and drive more contributions.
- Oversee redesign of Project Settings.
- Ongoing optimization of homepage based on user behaviour data and feedback.
- Assisting with product strategy, roadmap and feature prioritization.
- Actioning ad-hoc UX/UI design tasks when they pop up.
- Collaborating with the various disciplines across the Juicebox team to deliver an amazing and usable product.

I am confident in my ability to deliver on this and execute the list of priorities outlined in the roadmap. I believe I can add immense value to Juicebox and really looking forward to working together to create some magic.

## Risks

- I don’t deliver enough meaningful work during this period
- I don’t live up to my expectations

## Timeline

Starting at Peel FC#27 and continuing for 10 Funding cycles.
