Proposal 

Payout trial period: @sticklo $1500 for work done over the last 7 weeks (over 3 funding cycles)

Discord Discussion: I have mostly been observing while listening in at town hall meetings and stuff as I am still very new to web3, with a bit of interactions here and there in the discord, however, I am keen to become more involved in Peel and Juicebox in general.

How you plan to contribute going forward

- Time expectation: Currently averaging about 8hrs of work weekly.  Honestly, I want to do this fulltime. Quit my job IRL to do Web3/Dao stuff fully and I'm here for the long haul.  This isn't my final form yet, I could take it up a couple notches and I will, It has not been so easy working with bad internet connection, an old and struggling machine and  limited access to electricity, but once I am properly setup, my output would be better than it currently is. 


-Code Contribution: For now I  would stick to bug fixes and implementing small features. asides from being a junior coder, the tech stack used in the codebase is relatively new to me and most of the times I spend a lot of time to learn to do what I have to do to submit a successful PR.

I'm also keen to learning more about how web3 applications work

- Proof of work: I could not figure out a way to add all of my commits from my fork and my direct contributions to the repo so I just put my PRs in a google doc instead I hope that's okay  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g3PuuEYDFwqeYqZbUiyEqihMJW0Poolk-p751WVTBDU/edit?usp=sharing

- Governance: This is another avenue that I'm excited and willing  to participate in its discourse and see where it can go.
