## Proposal date:
July 25 2022

## Thesis
Add jmill and benschac to core team.

## Motivation
- lower code review burden
- greater decentralization of codebase ownership and multisig

## Specification

Add jmill and benschac:
- multisig
- github maintainers

## Rationale

Both Jmill and Ben have been around for a few months now. I've been nothing but stoked on the code they've been putting out. I feel I have enough evidence that they:
- are comfortable enough with the codebase norms.
- are great collaborators. take and give feedback well.
- have good ideas for how we can improve the codebase.

This will only increase with time.

## Risks
- Security. By giving more people merge access, we are adding more opportunity for the codebase to be compromised (if someone is hacked, etc.).

## Timeline
ASAP upon approval.
