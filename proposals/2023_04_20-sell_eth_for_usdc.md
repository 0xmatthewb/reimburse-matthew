## Proposal:

Buy 15,000 USDC with Peel ETH. 

## Rationale

- Our ~US$70k Peel Portfolio is almost 100% ETH. 
- With ETH prices close to a 10 month high, it may be wise to diversify into a lower risk asset. 
- Buying 15,000 USDC would have us about 20% exposed to the stable-coin, and about 80% to ETH.
