## Synopsis

Renew payout to Square Chain Labs Pty Ltd.

## Specification

- Continue 5k payout for the next 12 funding cycles.

## Rationale

Square Chain Labs, primarily through the talents of Lachlan McCulloch (aka wraeth), has significantly advanced the Juicebox front end (juicebox.money). Throughout the previous funding periods, Square Chain Labs consistently delivered superior quality work and became a crucial contributor to Juicebox's front end. The completed achievements under the guidance of Square Chain Labs during this time include:

- Refactored create flow to present new payout design and UX.
- Added governance to create flow
- Introduced Supabase to the Juicebox front-end for storing data.
- Built email engine and templates for sending notification emails.
- Add ability for users to subscribe to project pay notifications.
- Built new account settings general and notifications pages.
- Setup custom db auth flow on wallet connect.
- Created a new Modal component that is currently being used on announcement popups.
- Helped deliver the new brand refreshed home page.
- Built the new About page.
- Created a fun easter egg for May the 4th.
- Continued working toward utilising tailwind css and removing ant design.
  - Switched over to tailwind @base rules.
  - Removed selects in favour of headlessui listbox.
  - Rewrote nav bar to remove Ant Design components and use Tailwind CSS / headlessui.
- Continued to work on fixing bugs (both critical and non-critical).
- General code quality improvements.

Some of the key tasks that Square Chain Labs commits to accomplish in the next funding period include:

- Project page redesign code execution
- Project settings page redesign execution
- Ongoing email template support
- Create flow overhaul execution

With over a year's worth of deep understanding and contribution to the Juicebox front end, Square Chain Labs has proven to be a reliable, consistent, and valuable partner. I are proposing to continue working full time, adhering to the roadmap outlined by @tjl in Linear.

## Conclusion

In summary, renewing the payout for Square Chain Labs represents an investment
in proven talent and quality output. Their contributions thus far have enhanced
Juicebox's frontend significantly, driving progress and continuously improving
the user experience. The proposed work for the next 12 funding cycles promises
to maintain this trajectory of improvement, with substantial developments
already planned. By approving this proposal, Peel Dao will be endorsing the
continuation of a partnership that has yielded great results so far and promises
even more in the future. I eager to extend our collaboration and continue
working towards the collective goals of the Juicebox project. I thank Peel Dao
for its past support and look forward to potential future endeavours together.
