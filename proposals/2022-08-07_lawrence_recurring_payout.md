## Thesis

I am proposing to enter a recurring payout of $1800 in ETH per in the next  funding cycle as a UX Designer and also researcher, to work closely with the Peel core team that comprises of it's development and design team to make tactical and strategic user insights on Juicebox products and overall visual experience to improve the Infrastructure and additional inclusion of  products and features. Time dedication will be around 25-30 hours of effort per week, Coupled with running of hypersprints, facilitation of projects and user interview or testing of Prototypes.

## Motivation
Juicebox already has a dedicated core team that works on the building of the Infrastructure which is a funding platform that is highly desirable for Crowdfunding of projects and the de-facto interface in decentralized funding of projects. I believe having a UX Designer with proficient insights in User research and having points of variability in understanding the Web 3 infrastructure, combined with how data can be represented and contextualized in the General UI and grand scheme of the product will be invaluable. It will assist the design team with being a few steps ahead of the Development team.

## Specification
Provide $1800 in ETH per funding cycle as compensation to majordalaw.eth for 10 funding cycles in return UX Design, Research and Delightful UI Designs.

## Rationale

During my trial I contributed to Juicebox in Research, Design Insights, User testing of products and Strategic Insights on the Juicebox Product.

In the above mentioned individual tasks are ways that I have actively contributed to the efforts of the Peel Product and will be more willing with my efforts to put in the work to assist the efforts of the Core team with researched driven design with my capacity and understanding of the Web 3 infrastructure.

Oversee and assist the efforts of the design and core team to identify problems, iterating on ways to clarify it and give solutions on how it will be solved.
