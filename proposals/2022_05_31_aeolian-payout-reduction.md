## Summary

Renew aeolian's recurring payout.

## Specification

Renew aeolian's pay at US$4500/week, starting in Peel FC#18.

## Rationale

### The role

My role is a blend of technical, management, and product.

It's a blend of senior/staff engineer, engineering manager, UX design, and product management.

I put in well over 40 hours per week into Peel and Juicebox.

#### Technical responisibility

- I bare most resposibility for code merged.
- I've been responsible for complex, urgent features (like the recent V2 funding cycle relaunch bugfix).
- I provide architectural/technical guidance where necessary.
- I built the SDK and juice-hooks library, which we can eventually use on juicebox.money to save ~1MB in bundle size.
- I feel responsible for site reliability.
  - the translations broke and I had to investigate the fix. https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/1036
  - Fleek wasn't deploying and I reached out to their support, and added a related PR: https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/1086

#### Managerial resposibility

- We have a team of 5 - I feel responsible for making sure people everyone has something to work on, and that work is progressing.
- Peel governance:
  - I have ensured all Peel proposals are acted upon
  - I've queued all of Peel's multisig transactions (outside of infra expenses).
  - I wrote our hiring guide.
- I've been a spokesperson for Peel, giving progress reports in the JB townhall, as well as on Discord where needed.
- I frequently get pinged in the JB Discord to attend to bugs, support requests, and other frontend-related discussion.
- I feel responsible for ensuring issues for bugs/ideas are created in GitHub.

#### Product responsibility

- I've pushed the following product initiatives forward:
  - the homepage make over (new copy, small layout improvements, etc.
  - juicebox.money strategy effort
  - SEO improvements (our ranking continues to increase) https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/1010, https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/975
  - site analytics https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/970
