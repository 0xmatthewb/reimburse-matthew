### **Proposal date:**

March 12th 2023

### **Thesis**

There has been a keen interest in Juicebox contributors attending ETHGlobal Tokyo for an in-person meetup. This proposal is asking the Peel treasury to provide up to US$1500 to each Peel core contributor to fly to Tokyo, Japan to attend ETHGlobal.

### **Motivation**

Peel has never had an in-person meetup before. Most of the team have missed numerous opportunities to participate in meetups due to geographical restrictions. As a team we have been on the hunt for an opportunity that could allow us all to meet in a physical place in the world and ETHGlobal Tokyo fits the bill perfectly. 

### **Specification**

Provide up to US$1500 in ETH to each Peel core team contributor (as outlined below) to purchase return flights to Tokyo for ETHGlobal Tokyo.

**Payout breakdown:**

aeolian.eth: US$1500

peri.eth: US$1500

wraeth.eth: US$1500

johnnyd.eth: US$1500

strathmckay.eth: US$1500

timjl.eth: US$1500

**Total:** US$9000

*Contributors must provide valid flight receipts or return the allocated funds to the Peel treasury. 

### **Rationale**

Peel currently holds Ξ35.64 (~US$52,700) in its treasury, spending $9000 of this is a small price to pay to have the chance to meet in-person and collaborate. I believe this trip will boost team morale, facilitate collaboration and motivate the team to push our efforts to the next level. 

### **Risks**

- Some contributors can’t make it.
- Funds may be put to better use.

### **Timeline**

As soon as possible.
