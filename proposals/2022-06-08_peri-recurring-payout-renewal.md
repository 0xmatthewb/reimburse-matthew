# 2022-06-02 Peri Recurring Payout Renewal

## Reflection

Over the past 10 funding cycles, my responsibilities have been:
- Managing the juicebox.money subgraph implementation
- Guidance on high-level design & architecture

Some things I've done:
- Updates to the JB subgraph to accommodate the launch of the juicebox v2 protocol
- Extensive UI updates to enable compatibility with the new subgraph, including improvements to the project activity list and support for new project activity events
- Coordinating a smooth migration of the production app + subgraph integration from V1 to V2
- Design and (nearly complete) implementation of JBProjectHandles contract (outside of formal responsibilities)
- (Complete but not yet live) Subgraph compatibility with JBProjectHandles contract

## Proposal

Increase recurring payout from **US$3,000/FC** to **US$4,500/FC**

## Rationale

### Responsibilities

I'd like to keep my current responsibilities. I expect to spend at least a similar amount of energy as I have over the past 10 FCs on...
- Subgraph support for:
  - veBanny
  - paymentTerminals
  - directPaymentAddresses
- Researching and implementing if possible:
  - Indexing funding cycle data on the graph
  - Indexing additional project activity events (reconfigure, setUri, token minting)
- Other changes/improvements as needed

### Payout estimation

In the past I've graded payouts primarily against comparable web2 salaries, and haven't adequately taken into account the unique tradeoffs and risks associated with working in web3. I believe the work contributed to Peel (or any similar DAO) is worth more than the value I've placed on it previously. 

Also, my familiarity and expertise with the Graph have grown much more nuanced over the past 10 FCs. I expect to be doing smarter and more efficient work going forward.
