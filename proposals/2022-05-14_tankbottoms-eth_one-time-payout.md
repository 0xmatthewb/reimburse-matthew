### risks

- tankbottoms' feelings are hurt and he follows up all future posts with a cartoon of a puppy dog with sad eyes
- tankbottoms' uses the funds to level up Peel's discord with stickers of vegetables and fruits without traditional peels, thereby offending the community
- tankbottoms' pretends to not have understood that retroactive reimbursements are not favored and does this continuously just to be annoying
- jmills turns out to be a complete knob and actually subtracts value thereby being a complete waste of time and ETH
