### **Propposal date:**

December 10 2022.

### **Thesis**

Renew and increase the Peel contract between Wraeth and Peel via:

- Removal of `wraeth.eth` payout; and
- Replace with `squarechainlabs.eth` (Square Chain Labs PTY LTD).

### **Motivation**

I'd like to extend and increase my payout until the next Peel proposal to JuiceboxDAO. The increase I am asking for is US$1000, payable in ETH (total of US$5000). I feel I have been delivering on my previous proposal and am now at a level where I feel I have a strong understanding of the project and its intricacies.

#### **Wraeth's Contribution**

During the last few months I have continued to work on the Juicebox front-end to a high standard. In the time since my last proposal I have:

- Significantly helped with the transition from a SPA architecture to the now used NextJS architecture. This has included refatoring of the codebase to be used in a server-side rendered environment.
- Added SEO capabilities to the front-end, including meta tags.
- Worked closely with Strath to realise the vision for the new create flow. This has included designing the software architecture, implementing all the logic and components, and building a close 1:1 UI with the designs.
- Any immediate tasks that have come up, including bug fixes, small feature requests, and general improvements to the codebase.
- Code improvements and quality of life changes to the Juice-Interface codebase, such as TailwindCSS.

**POW:**

- https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3Awraeth-eth

Until the next Peel proposal to JuiceboxDAO, I will continue to work on the Juicebox front-end. I would like to see through the following:

- Versioning updates to allow simple and smooth transitions of projects to V3.
- Initial templating for 'quick create' projects.
- Improve the mobile experience of the front-end.
- Whatever new or pressing requirements are introduced to Peel.

#### **Square Chain Labs**

Square Chain Labs Pty Ltd is an Australian company, run and operated by Lachlan McCulloch (aka _wraeth_), of which Lachlan is the sole director.

This proposal ratifies the relationship between Peel and Square Chain Labs PTY LTD.

### **Specification**

- Remove payout to `wraeth.eth`.
- Add **US$5000** (paid in ETH) payout to `squarechainlabs.eth`.

### **Rationale**

During my time working on Juicebox I tend to show up most days and remain available for any discussion on Discord. I am constantly committing code, and reviewing others code. I am also constantly working on the Juicebox front-end, and have been for the last 6 months. I LOVE how performant and tight juicebox.money has become and want to continue to help shape and drive the project forward.

**Terms:**

- I commit to delivering the listed outcomes at the agreed price, regardless of how long the work takes.
- If there are errors or issues with the delivery of the outcomes, I agree to resolve those issues at no additional expense
- I agree to use my own equipment to perform all work.

### **Timeline**

Timeline starts at Peel **FC#45** and continues for 8 Funding cycles until Peel **FC#53** (until JuiceboxDAO **~FC#41**).
