## Proposal

Peri informed me that shortly after i came, you all decided to stop onboarding new paid contributors.

I want to determine whether there is any room for last-minute adjustment with the proposal.

I'm proposing that in return for 20 to 30 hours of work per week, i join a team with a $600 payout per FC.

I understand that the team has expanded, and you might not have time to review or react to my work, but i think i've spent a lot of time over the previous two weeks learning about the project and the codebase so effort to review / respond to my stuff would be much smaller.

I feel i'd be less likely to block your work and more like the person who would clean up the mess while the rest of you concentrated on your tasks if i just accepted issues moving forward and occasionally proposed smaller feature requests ( i've already have couple in mind )

## Specifications

Provide $600USD in ETH per funding cycle as compensation to 0xa13d49fCbf79EAF6A0a58cBDD3361422DB4eAfF1 for 4 funding cycles in return for sharp frontend help.

## Motivation

Motivation is huge here, i enjoy and admire your work, it would be my privilege to continue working on this as i feel relaxed and creative while working on everything that is assigned to me.
