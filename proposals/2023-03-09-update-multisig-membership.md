# update multisig membership

Jmill and Benjamin were past Peel contributors who volunteered to be on the multisig.

They haven't been active Peel contributors for the last few months.

This proposal is to remove them from the multisig effective immediately.

## Spec

- remove jmill.eth and benschac.eth from the multisig signing policy
- new approval policy: 4/5 signatures required (note: currently it is 4/7)
