Proposal

### **Proposal date:**

8th May, 2023.

### **Thesis**

Renew and reduce the payout to *Big Fundamentals Tech* (JohnnyD) from $US4500 to US$3600. 

### **Motivation**

- Adhere to re-aligning our payouts with current work capacity (as per latest discussions).
- Cut costs for our upcoming Peel proposal.
- Increase Peel/JB runway. 

### **Specification**

Renew and reduce the payout to V2 Juicebox project *@johnnyd* from $US4500 to US$3600.

### **Rationale**

Since we loosely agreed to $4-5k being the benchmark for full-time work, I would like to cut back my pay under this level to reflect my current 4-day per week equivalent average work week. 

### **Outcomes** 

- Develop the next Juicebox feature set, such as the Apps ecosystem, project page and/or create-flow updates.
- Continue squashing bugs that pop up. 

**Terms:**

- I commit to delivering the listed outcomes at the agreed price, regardless of how long the work takes.
- If there are errors or issues with the delivery of the outcomes, I agree to resolve those issues at no additional expense.
- I agree to use my own equipment to perform all work.

### **Timeline**

Starting at V2 Peel FC#19 and continuing until next Peel/JB proposal (~3.5 months from now).
