üçå PROPOSAL: refund gas for transactions every 10 funding cycles

Any transaction related to Peel that incurs a cost to a contributor (either in ETH value or gas) should be refunded to the executor.
The following are examples of types of transactions that meet the criteria:
- executing multisig transactions (for example, buying USDC, reconfiguring JB projects)
- distributing payouts and reserve tokens

If this proposal passes, I will define the above in our Notion.

We will keep track of transactions in our finance spreadsheet.
