## Proposal date:
July 21 2022

## Thesis
I am proposing that I enter a Trial Period as a UX/UI Designer working closely with Peel on optimising the Juicebox User Experience & Interface. I propose that the Trial Period last two funding cycles (FC#25 - FC#26) and that I receive a payout of $600 USD in ETH per funding cycle.

## Motivation
Juicebox is amazing and has done an incredible job creating an engaged and supportive community, but as it starts to gain traction and further ‘mainstream’ adoption it will require a dedicated User Experience and Interface designer to ensure our users and the community have a seamless and delightful experience when they interact with any part of the Juicebox platform. 

## Specification
Provide $600USD in ETH per funding cycle as compensation to strathmckay.eth for 2 funding cycles in return for wealth of UX and Visual deign knowledge and implementation.

## Rationale
Firstly, I feel like my unique skillset can add immense value to Juicebox as a whole. With a background in Visual Design and experience in product, agency and marketing I can help optimise many aspects of Juicebox experience for maximum functionality and enjoyability for our users.

I have already begun making meaningful contributions to JB, starting with redesigning a simplified Token Form for the Project Token section of Project Creation.

With a quick analysis, I can see many ways to optimise the current Juicebox interface and design to create a more usable and engaging experience. Let me prove my worth in this trial period, I would love to start by redesigning the Project Creation Flow.

## Risks
- I may not be as good as my proposal
- I could get stuck on a task and deliver less value than proposed

## Timeline
2 Funding cycles duration, starting at FC#25.
