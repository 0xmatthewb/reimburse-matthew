### 3. Reductions

Ratify the following general guiding principles for payout reductions:

> start

Contributors should consider reducing their payout if they are no longer able to fulfill responsibilities due to other committments, extended holiday without laptop access, etc.

Contributors are encouraged to deliver feedback to other contributors in private, 1:1 conversations, not in public. The following describes some general principles for giving feedback:
- Feedback should assume positive intent.
- Feedback should seek to improve the recipient's abilitiy to contribute, not vilify them.
- Feedback should be as objective as possible.
- Feedback can be in response to a contributor not being able to fulfill their responsibilities, or other concerns.
- Feedback should be unemotional and not personal.

Payout reductions are not necessarily permanent.

No new contributors for the duration of this proposal. Exception: if a contributor's capacity is reduced such that the team will lack in the
 given function, then a new contributor may be onboarded to fill the gap.

## Timeline
