üçå  PROPOSAL: remove reserved token allocation for torvusbug.eth  starting in FC#11.

I love Torvus! He's made super valuable contributions to Juicebox and Peel, and I really would love if we could steal more of his time. But, I totally get that life happens. I feel our reserved tokens should be allocated to active contributors.

@Torvus Bug , sincerely hope there are no hard feelings here. I'll :100~1: support any contributions or proposals from you in future. Nothing but love over here :tilelove: :aPES_GiveLove: 

Our new reserved token allocation would become:

peri.eth: 18.75%
johnnyd.eth: 18.75%
aeolian.eth: 18.75%
jasonz.eth: 18.75%
multisig (project owner): 25%

If this proposal passes, I will queue up a transaction to reconfigure our reserved token allocation starting in FC#11
