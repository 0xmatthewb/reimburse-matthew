PROPOSAL 

Reduce my payout from $3000 to $2500 per week, declare that it cannot increase for any renewal I make for the next 6 months (26 FC's), and grant me 2M JBX from the Peel treasury. I won't be reducing my workload or responsibilities at all. I feel more motivated to work harder on this product than ever. 

Why

I think there is an imbalance between my cash compensation and my 'equity' in Juicebox as an early contributor. I want to exchange my short-term profits for the chance of a bigger payout down the road, which will align my incentives better with the long-term success of Juicebox. My two latest messages as well as @aeolian's latest in this thread are also relevant but I won't repeat them here: https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/963551788823375932

Justification

Sacrificing $500 per week is $13,000 over the 6 months I would commit to, which is approximately what 2M JBX redeems for right now (4.55 ETH). 

Risks

- This only makes sense if I maintain my current work output for the next 6 months. If I bail before then I've gained more from this than I've saved Peel. 
- Also wouldn't make sense if I just sold this JBX in the next 6 months. Wish I could stake it but you'd just have to trust me.
