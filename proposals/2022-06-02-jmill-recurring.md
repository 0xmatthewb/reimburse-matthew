# 2022-06-02 Jmill Recurring

## Proposal Date

June 02, 2022

## What

Compensate jmill (0x1b87d5d68d5100B97F92F0EB7dE46AD46C19b5F9) US3,000 (in ETH) per funding cycle for frontend
development with Peel while spearheading development on veBanny UI/UX. Time expectation: ~25-30 hours of effort a week for a few focused weeks until the MVP of veBanny is shipped. This proposal would only be for the next couple of weeks, as opposed to the usual 10 FC recurring proposal since i feel i am under special circumstances with the focused veBanny work.

## Why

Working heavily on the veBanny frontend development branch, as well as additional contributions to the main branch through various features and fixes while veBanny was blocked or in limbo:

## Closing

I am very interested in a focused work sprint for a couple of weeks to get this thing out the door and ready to start being tested and work towards integration in the frontend. I am on vacation this weekend and at the end of my trial period but interested in going full steam ahead on it over the next weeks.

Upon completion of the veBanny project, I am open to a re-evaluation of how I can contribute to JBX, Peel, and the project overall since I am very much enjoying the work and team.
