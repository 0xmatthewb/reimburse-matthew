Proposal

### **Proposal date:**

October 17th 2022.

### **Thesis**

Renew JohnnyD's payout.

### **Motivation**

Iâ€™m proposing to extend my payout until the next Peel payout renewal is due (start of 2023).

Since my [last proposal](https://github.com/peeldao/proposals/pull/11/files), I believe I've upheld my specified responsibilities as well as improve my skills across the board in the areas mentioned.

My key upcoming goals:
- Deliver a tight NFT rewards to Mainnet, continuing liasing with the Contract Crew to give feedback and integrate their updates.
- Continue developing the Safe page: ability to sign tx's, diff view for JB transactions and more. 
- Whatever next big dev update we choose to tackle - possibly project page - I'm keen to take on. 

### **Specification**

Continue the US$4500 (in ETH) payout to johnnyd.eth.

### **Rationale**

- I've continued to pump out code consistently, both small and more critical fixes, as well as larger features such as:
    - NFT rewards
    - Safe page 
    - One-click Snapshot setup
    - See all PRs: https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3Ajohnnyd-eth.
    
- I show up to the Discord daily, always quick to respond to messages related to my work, particularly NFT rewards / StudioDAO-related. 
    e.g. scroll through [NFT rewards (frontend)](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/990055537615970384) and [NFT rewards (contracts)](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/987105293810938007)
    
- Design and implement parts of UI where necessary:
    e.g. - Snapshot setup (https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/1930)
         - NFT loaders (https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/1815)
         - Parts of Safe page (scroll through https://discord.com/channels/939317843059679252/1017284887008522321).
    
- Quick to reviews, providing detailed feedback for new contributors ensuring our codebase standards and practices are maintained:
    e.g. https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/1993, https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/2043.
    
- Always prowling the Bugs, Design and Frontend channels for messages from the community to convert to GH issues for developers. 

**Terms:**
- I commit to delivering the listed outcomes at the agreed price, regardless of how long the work takes.
- If there are errors or issues with the delivery of the outcomes, I agree to resolve those issues at no additional expense.
- I agree to use my own equipment to perform all work.

### **Timeline**

Starting at Peel FC#39 and continuing for 15 Funding cycles (until JB FC#41, ~15 weeks).
