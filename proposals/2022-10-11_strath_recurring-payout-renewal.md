### **Proposal date:**

October 11th 2022

### **Thesis**

We are coming to the end of my previously proposed 10 funding cycle recurring payout, I have absolutely loved working with the Peel team on taking the Juicebox app to the next level and would like to submit a new proposal for the renewal of my recurring payout for another 10 funding cycles. Now that I have settled in I feel I can give a huge amount of my focus and energy to JB and continue to provide unique value to the team. Time expectation of around 30+ hours of effort per week (with availability to scale up during crucial sprints or projects).

### **Motivation**

I have a unique set of skills, balancing UX thinking and research with sharp visual design skills and a keen eye for detail that I believe can provide immense value and insight to the Peel team and Juicebox as a whole. Having a dedicated UX/UI designer within the team will allow us to prioritise features and make decisions based on data and focus on what will be most important and impactful to our core users to create a meaningful experience and a beautiful interface.

### **Specification**

Provide US$2600 in ETH per funding cycle as compensation to strathmckay.eth for 10 funding cycles in return for solid UX and Visual Design.

### **Rationale**

Over the past 10 funding cycles, I have contributed solid value to Juicebox and Peel in a number of ways through design, research & strategy. A few examples include:

-   Redesign of the Project Creation flow --- including restructuring information architecture, wireframing and delivering high fidelity prototypes for both mobile and desktop. Collaborating with @ w and the team on the build to ensure that we are creating an optimal and easy to use experience.

-   Dived into the accessibility and consistency of the Juicebox app and developed a solution based on both accessibility and user tests to overhaul and refresh the Juicebox brand to not only meet modern web accessibility and contrast standards but to propel the JB brand into a new era, ensuring brand recall, uniqueness and longevity.

-   Carried out a number of user testing sessions to gain insight on the JB product and validate key design decisions throughout the process.

-   UX & UI design of the NFT rewards delivering high-fidelity prototypes and working with @ j on the implementation --- [](https://www.figma.com/file/XEBCjxletE7rDdbj3Mk8lV/JBX---NFT-Rewards-UI---July-2022?node-id=0%3A1)<https://www.figma.com/file/XEBCjxletE7rDdbj3Mk8lV/JBX---NFT-Rewards-UI---July-2022?node-id=0%3A1>
-   Tracking and analysing user behaviour across the site using heat maps and recordings to gain an understanding of how people were using the product and where they were getting stuck or confused.
-   As well as advising on and actioning various UX tasks and decisions throughout the product.


**Over the next 10 funding cycles I would like to focus on:**

-   Implementing the proposed brand refresh and delivering a new brand identity with a solid style guide that can be referenced across all disciplines at Juicebox.
-   Once new brand styles have been defined, completely optimise the site for mobile (mobile traffic makes up close to 40% of our user base).
-   Optimise the overall project owner experience and continue to test and iterate.
-   Redesign the Project Page based on user data and feedback to build more trust and drive more contributions.
-   Redesign an optimised version of the homepage based on user behaviour, data and feedback.
-   Dive into more product strategy, roadmap and feature prioritization.
-   Actioning various UX/UI design tasks when they pop up.
-   Collaborating with the team across the Juicebox to deliver an amazing and usable product.

I am confident in my ability to deliver on this and execute the list of priorities outlined in the loose roadmap above. Really looking forward to continuing my work within the Peel team.

### **Risks**

-   I don't deliver enough meaningful work during this period

### **Timeline**

Starting at Peel FC#38 and continuing for 10 Funding cycles
