# 2022-06-02 Jmill Recurring

## Proposal Date

June 02, 2022

## What

Compensate jmill (0x1b87d5d68d5100B97F92F0EB7dE46AD46C19b5F9) **US3,000** (in ETH) per funding cycle for **10 funding cycles** for frontend
development with Peel while spearheading development on veBanny UI/UX, and to work extensively on veBanny follow-up work and new initiatives in the coming weeks.

Time expectation: ~25-30 hours of effort a week. Plus or minus as needed depending on timelines and workload.

## Why

Working heavily on the veBanny frontend development branch, as well as additional contributions to the main branch through various features and fixes while veBanny was blocked or in limbo:

After veBanny is finished, I would like to continue to lead initiatives building new features since i feel very comfortable with the codebase and contracts at this point and I think my skills would lead to rapid development cycles.

## Closing

I am very interested in a focused work sprint for a couple of weeks to get this thing out the door and ready to start being tested and work towards integration in the frontend. I am on vacation this weekend and at the end of my trial period but interested in going full steam ahead on it over the next weeks.

Upon completion of the veBanny project, I would like to continue to contribute in a significant way to the Peel team and Juicebox frontend.
