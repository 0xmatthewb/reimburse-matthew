Proposal

### **Proposal date:**

November 4th 2022

### **Thesis**

Renew Peri's payout of US$4,500/FC

### **Motivation**

Compensate Peri for continuing to uphold current responsibilities, described below:

- Maintenance of and prompt improvements to the JB Subgraph as necessary
- JB UI improvements that are required to maintain compatibility with the subgraph
- Ensure Subgraph billing is up to date and bookkeeping information is made accessible
- Subgraph devops support, including documentation/resources required to ensure the codebase is accessible
- Meaningful participation in design, product, and organizational decision making
- Management of IPFS financing

### **Specification**

Continue US$4,500 per funding cycle payout to peri.eth

### **Rationale**

Since my last payout proposal, I've continued to maintain the Juicebox Subgraph, including:
- Complex pattern upgrades to the Subgraph to support V3 contracts alongside existing versions
- Architectural & procedural improvements to the Subgraph repo for a smoother dev experience + reduced possibility for shipping bugs
- Maintenace of internal + external subgraph docs
- Promptly addressing bugs
- Ensuring the Subgraph is sufficiently accessible by multisig members
- Ensuring the Subgraph billing balance is up to date and bookkeeping information is readily available

I've also continued to manage UI upgrades to the Juicebox app to support compatibility with new Subgraph changes.

In addition to dev work, I believe I've contributed reasonably to design, product, and organizational decisions relating to the Peel team.

**Terms:**
- I commit to delivering the listed outcomes at the agreed price, regardless of how long the work takes.
- If there are errors or issues with the delivery of the outcomes, I agree to resolve those issues at no additional expense.
- I agree to use my own equipment to perform all work.

### **Timeline**

Starting at Peel FC#40 and continuing for at least 15 Funding cycles.
