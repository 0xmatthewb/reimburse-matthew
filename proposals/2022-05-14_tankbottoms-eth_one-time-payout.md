Per a phone call between Aeolian and Peri regarding locating/referring an individual to Peel, general guidelines of either Russian developers at $10-15k per month, or other individuals from $2k to $3.5k per week. The outcome of the discussion was to locate additional contributors and that I would inquire about the Russian developers I knew and or refer and individual to contribute after some assessment of competency. It was explicit that I would have to commit funds ahead (in the ranges above) which Peel would reimburse to me after a funding cycle.

Various discussions regarding Peel resources were discussed here -
