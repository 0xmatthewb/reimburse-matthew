# 2022-05-12 Wraeth Recurring

## Proposal Date

May 12, 2022

## What

Compensate wraeth.eth US2,000 (in ETH) per funding cycle for frontend
development on Peel. Time expectation: 15-20 hours of effort a week, potentially
more time permitting. (Generally about the same cadence I have been outputting
during the trial period)

## Why

Commits to main:
https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/commits?author=wraeth-eth

**or**

Closed issues with PR:

The biggest JB changes I feel I have contributed so far is tightening up some of
the UX surrounding the V2 Create and reconfigure forms and flows.

Notable changes:

- Modal popups to protect a user from accidentally discarding their changes in
  Create and Reconfigure;
- Fixing up some state management issues in reconfigure for ensuring that user
  can only click deploy when they have actual changes.

I feel confident enough to work on just about any feature or bug the Peel team
can throw at me now.

## Closing

I am interested in committing to Juicebox development for a long term period (90
days) with the intention of extending the recurrence in the future (if you guys
will have me, of course ;)).

Just generally want to become more involved in Peel and Juicebox; I think it is
amazing what this team has achieved so far and want to be a bigger part of it!
Not only is it awesome tech, but the team itself is extremely cohesive,
friendly, and are super aligned in their goals and expectations. I think big
things can be achieved here!
