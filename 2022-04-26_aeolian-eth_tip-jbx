@Peeler (core team) proposal tip @Benjamin , @Wraeth @sticklo and @Wade  50,000 JBX each for contributions thus far.

This is really just a "token" of appreciation rather than compensation - it's not worth much but it gives these folks who have been helping out an opportunity to participate in JB governance. And it helps achieve the original goal of our JBX, which was to further diversify JBX ownership.
