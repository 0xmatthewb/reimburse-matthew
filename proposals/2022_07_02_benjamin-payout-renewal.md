# Proposal

- 5-7 hours a week @ $120 an hour on a recurring basis. ($800) - Somewhere around 6-7 hours a week.
- continue working on small features and quality of life improvements for JBX/Peel

## Why

- I left my job about a month ago dealing with some health issues. I'd like to continue making smaller contributions to the Peel / stay involved.

## Work Completed / In Progress

- The work wasn't merged but it helped PeelDAO make the choice of moving away from CRA and switching over to next.js (<https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/867> upgrading to react scripts 5).
- <https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/commit/757d7d77ee83dfe10a5d25dbb5efe6ef8f95e142> add project owner to project page header
- <https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/1135/commits/a72f0608dda8d0ec9fec0b398bba2b0618abb0a4> updated eslint rules which @aeolianeth took to the finish line.
- <https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/1073> Added ts-prune to find and remove dead code.
- <https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/1050> fixed up lint-staged config to format the entire project.
- <https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/issues?q=is%3Aissue+author%3A0xbakedpotato+is%3Aclosed> reported UX and cross browser bugs

## In progress

- <https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/issues/1223> currently working on this
- I'm happy to do just about anything within the 5-7 hour time frame I can commit to right now.
