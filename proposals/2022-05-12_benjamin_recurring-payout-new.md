Proposal

- moving forward 5-7 hours a week @ $120 an hour on a recurring basis.
- retroactively  I was paid a 50k jbx one-time fee, but I've been contributing for the last 2 1/2 weeks pretty consistently. I'd like to be paid the 2 1/2 weeks at the trail rate in my last proposal @ $600 a week: https://discord.com/channels/939317843059679252/940041243491201055/966877528625131582

Why
- I work a full-time job but would like to contribute and be involved in the work PeelDAO is doing. I love front-end, y'all are pretty cool and have great vibes, and I'm pretty stoked on JBX and PEEL.


Work Completed In Progress
- https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/867 upgrading to react scripts 5.
- https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/commits?author=benschac 
While there hasn't been much code, most of the work done was researching and communicating detailed technical work. Why it's needed, how to do it, and context around the choices made from documentation and searching.

Work in the future
- I'm happy to do just about anything. But, I know I could be particularly helpful working on housekeeping tasks like the react scripts upgrade that just needs to be done while y'all push on the product. But, really, happy to help with whatever needs to be done.


Either way, this has been super fun / positive experience contributing with y'all! If anyone is ever in NYC please don't be a stranger.
