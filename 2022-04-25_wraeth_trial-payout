Proposal

Payout trial period: @Wraeth $600 per week @ ~10 hours of work per week (potentially double if time/schedule permitting).
Trial Period duration: 2 weeks.

Links to all landed PRs: https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/commits?author=wraeth-eth
Discord Discussion: Mostly lurking, with some small input here and there. Keen to become more involved in Juicebox and Peel in general.

How you plan to contribute going forward
- Time expectation: I am planning to continue contributing at least 10 hours for the trial period, maybe some more depending on how much extra free time I have.
- Code contribution: 
    - General code quality increase. I want to spend some time, if possible, implementing some automated code testing via e2e, int, and unit tests.
    - Don't mind working on bug fixes, or full blown features. Big or small, bring it on! ðŸ˜Ž 
    - I also wouldn't mind learning more about how web3 applications behave and work in general - this is relatively new grounds for me and what I have been exposed to so far (via JB) I have found very exciting.
- Governance: Really excited to participate in discussions and see where JB can go!
