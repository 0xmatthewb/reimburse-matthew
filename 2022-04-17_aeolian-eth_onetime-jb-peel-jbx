PROPOSAL Create Juicebox DAO proposal for one-time JBX distribution to Peel.

Juicebox DAO is quite dependent on Peel by virtue of us stewarding juicebox.money. Peel's ETH payout is very reasonable, however is a somewhat short-term incentive. It should be in Juicebox DAO's best interest to incentivize Peel for as long as possible. JBX is the best mechanism for doing so.

Outside of incentives, it gives Peel greater ownership over the protocol for governance purposes. As builders we are particularly exposed to risks from a number of angles, particularly involving Juicebox DAO governance, and having greater voting power helps mitigate this to some degree. And because we are builders, we are incentivized to vote in the best interest of other Juicebox projects and users generally - juicebox.money and Peel don't exist without users.

I want to propose a one-time JBX distribution to Peel of 50,000,000 JBX (50 million).
- Juicebox DAO currently has 164,346,223 JBX, so 50 million JBX represents 30% of Juicebox DAO's JBX holding.
- JBX total supply is 2,464,574,735, so 50 million JBX represents 2% of total supply

@Peeler (core team)  thoughts? opinions?
