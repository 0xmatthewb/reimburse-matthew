Proposal

### **Proposal date:**

October 17th 2022.

### **Thesis**

Renew aeolians payout.

### **Motivation**

I’d like to extend my payout until the beginning of 2023 (until the next Peel payout renewal is due).

I believe I am continuing to fulfill the roles and responsibilities outlined in my previous proposal: https://github.com/peeldao/proposals/pull/7.
My feeling is that Peel still needs someone in a ‘lead’ capacity: making decisions where required, being a spokesperson and advocate where required, and generally helping shape the direction of JBM. This, in addition to building.

Here’s what I’d like to get done by the end of the year:
- A tight multi treasury experience. This includes token redemptions across multiple treasuries, giving projects a fully-featured upgrade path, and easier visibility into a project’s multiple treasuries. It’s a long but necessary road.
- Integrate the SDK an hooks library into jbm, and properly release those packages.
- Potentially work on a React component library (hybrid of Juice Pay and a base component lib) that adds a more performant and secure “pay with juicebox” to a project’s own website.
- Tidying up loose ends, both UI and codebase. There’s many small issues that collectively lead to a suboptimal experience on the site. Let’s fix these.
- Investigate fiat onramps.
- Whatever else!

### **Specification**

Keep US$7000 (in ETH) payout to aeolian.eth.

### **Rationale**

I show up mostly every day, responding to questions across the Discord, keeping tabs on the state of things, giving code reviews and helping with product direction/strategy. And of course, pumping out a lot of code.

Highlights:
- V3 transition, including coming upgrade UI.
- SDK, hooks library, Juice Pay. Used in production by real projects (MCSA, nance, etc.)
- Many bug fixes, UX improvements and cleanup, site performance improvements, and cleanup https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/commits?author=tomquirk
- Safe UI product direction, initial design and implementation scaffolding.
- Initial create flow shaping and on-going feedback.
- Consistent and (mostly) timely code review.

Terms:
- I commit to delivering the listed outcomes at the agreed price, regardless of how long the work takes.
- If there are errors or issues with the delivery of the outcomes, I agree to resolve those issues at no additional expense
- I agree to use my own equipment to perform all work.

### **Timeline**

Starting at Peel FC#38 and continuing for 15 Funding cycles (until JB FC#41, ~15 weeks).
