## Proposal date
22 July 2022

## Thesis
I am proposing to enter a trial period as a UI/UX designer working closely with the peel team in creating usable and scalable research driven design. I propose that the trial period last two funding cycles (FC#25-FC#26) and that i receive a payout $600 USD in ETH per funding cycle.

## Motivation
Juicebox is an amazing community that i was introduced to by Zeugh, he onboarded me through a well thought and extensive conversation, we had on how JB can use my skill sets in enhancing the utility it provides to users. And also how in general we can make the funding of projects through the JB platform readily accessible and useful to people across the web 3 space.

## Specification
Provide $600USD in ETH per funding as compensation to {0xaB0D1716f7BcB89516d8be6933a12bCfFfd4d3d1} for to funding cycles in return for UX research, UI design, recruiting of testers that will test our prototypes to give us feedback before code implementation.

## Rationale
I have already started working on the JB Website and Project funding platform, by:
- writing an interview script for testing users
- recruiting testers that are primary targets and market fits that can give us feedback that will greatly influence our product
- having interview sessions already with them
- making a documentation/pitchdeck that i will use and present the research finding to PEEL.

Not only by the research aspect of the designs, I can also make changes in the figma files and present a prototype that can be built for better usable and delightful experience.
With the current UX problems, that has been revealed by the testers that have sufficient knowledge on how funding platforms work and also i have already started making meaningful contributions to JB with the User testing and point out the UI/UX challenges users face.

Also  on how we can aim to reduce decision paralysis on the funding platform  and confusion for users by improving design, structure, copy, and CTA positioning.

## Risks
- I may not be good as my proposal.
- My research process might be too slow or not as fast moving as we want implementation

## Timeline
Two funding cycles, starting at FC#25
