# Strath Payout Renewal & Increase

### **Proposal date:**

May 22nd 2023

### **Thesis**

Renew and increase Strath’s recurring payout from $3800 to $5000 per cycle. *

### **Motivation**

Peel is in unique position, as the builders and custodians of [juicebox.money](http://juicebox.money/), it is our responsibility to ensure we provide a seamless, enjoyable and functional experience to all of our users. I strongly believe that strategic human-centered design is essential in achieving this and driving the growth of Juicebox as a whole.

This role requires the rare combination of 3 things: an in-depth knowledge of Juicebox and how it functions, a deep understanding of crypto & its various nuances and impeccable UX/UI design skills. I believe I am the best person to fill this role and given the chance I will continue to pour my heart and soul into Juicebox, making it my primary focus to help take Juicebox and JBM to the next level.

### **Specification**

Provide US$5000 in ETH per funding cycle as compensation to Strath (0x1E2B964Ddfed2bD32b99513ac2357B7B0c3ed94f) * for 12 funding cycles in return for exceptional UX & UI Design. With the expectation for Strath to contribute at a full-time capacity over this period.

### **Rationale**

Having actively contributed to PeelDAO for nearly a year, I have gained an in-depth understanding of the Juicebox protocol and consistently delivered on my proposals. Throughout the past four months, my contribution has added significant value to both Juicebox and Peel, through high-level design, research & strategy.

**A few examples include:**

- Complete strategic rebrand of Juicebox and JBM — including logos, colours, fonts, style guides and all UI components. See examples here — [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MmEGFTpC5y4mpt9LVOd44XRKMJqItIWu?usp=share_link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MmEGFTpC5y4mpt9LVOd44XRKMJqItIWu?usp=share_link)
- Redesign & ship a new homepage for Juicebox money to align with our roadmap and overall strategy. See — [juicebox.money](http://juicebox.money/)
- Design of various new website updates and pages such as About Us, Contact form, Case studies and more. See — [juicebox.money](http://juicebox.money/)
- Redesign of new Juicebox project page (in final stages for handover)
- Overseeing all parts of the Juicebox design process.
- Interviewing and gathering feedback from users to inform design decisions.
- Ground-up creation and ongoing updates of a new Juicebox design system (colours, components, organisation etc) used as the building blocks and guide for all future design on JBM.

- Keeping up with all UX issues in Discord and consistently delivering solutions, giving advice and actioning various UX/UI design tasks and decisions throughout the product.
- Running various workshops with Peel and JB DAO teams to ensure alignment, brainstorm ideas and create prioritised visions for the future of the product.

**Over the next 12 funding cycles my focus will be:**

- Delivering on the roadmap with ‘apps’, create flow, templates etc.
- Leading the design effort for all future Peel projects
- Updates of project page as we gather feedback and data after implementation
- Refinement of overall JBM user experience based on data gathered post website updates
- Consistently talking to our users to gather as much valuable insight and data as possible.
- Collaborating with development to ensure the product is always polished and usable.

I am confident in my ability to deliver on this proposal and execute the list of priorities outlined above. Really looking forward to continuing my work within the Peel team <3

### **Risks**

- I don’t deliver enough meaningful work during this period
- Overspending of the Peel treasury

### **Timeline**

Starting at Peel V3 FC#22 (June 4th 2023) and continuing for 12 funding cycles (in line with the duration of our JuiceboxDAO proposal and payout).

### Notes

- Changing my payout wallet address — please remove strathmckay.eth from payouts & add 0x1E2B964Ddfed2bD32b99513ac2357B7B0c3ed94f. (ENS coming soon)
- Increase is pending outcome of Peel’s JBDAO proposal (with the assumption it will be renewed at $60K). If anything changes with the Peel payout, I am happy to revisit the payout amount and terms of this proposal.
