# **Strath Payout Renewal and Increase**



## **Proposal date:**

January 16th 2023

## **Thesis**

I am proposing to renew and increase my recurring payout as a Peel contributor until the next Peel proposal to JuiceboxDAO. I have absolutely loved working with Peel so far on building and designing the Juicebox frontend and I believe I have been delivering on my previous proposal. I have now closed all of my other projects and am ready and able to put 100% of my energy into Juicebox.

## **Motivation**

Having a dedicated UX/UI designer within the Peel team allows us to prioritise features, make decisions based on data and focus on what is most important and impactful to our users to create a meaningful experience and a beautiful interface.

## **Specification**

Provide US$3800 in ETH per funding cycle as compensation to naisho.eth (previously strathmckay.eth) for 4 funding cycles in return for exceptional UX and Visual Design.

## **Rationale**

Over the past 10 funding cycles, I have contributed and delivered meaningful value to Juicebox and Peel in a number of ways through design, research & strategy. A few examples include:

- Design new iterations of the Project Creation flow based on real user feedback, testing and data — including restructuring UI, information architecture, wireframing and delivering high fidelity prototypes for both mobile and desktop.

- Performed an accessibility audit of the entire Juicebox app and developed a solution based on WCAG guidelines, delivering high fidelity designs with annotations on all elements that required immediate attention.

- Worked on Juicebox project discovery — brainstorming workshop to generate actionable ideas. Prioritised project discovery tasks. Designed various parts of the UX/UI to assist with improved project discovery.

- Started homepage redesign process beginning with research and wireframes
- Carried out a number of usability testing sessions and user interviews to ensure that we are delivering an optimal and easy to use experience as well as to gain insight into user friction points and confusion. Examples here — [https://www.awesomescreenshot.com/s/folder/F02oxAabZP/c6d3f84f6dc9848a95f072931ffc7475](https://www.awesomescreenshot.com/s/folder/F02oxAabZP/c6d3f84f6dc9848a95f072931ffc7475)
- Continued UX & UI evolution of Juicebox NFTs as the contracts evolve, delivering high-fidelity prototypes and working with JohnnyD on the implementation
- Updated various parts of the project page UI
- Continued improvement and updating of the Juicebox design system (colours, components, organisation etc)
- Keeping up with all UX issues in Discord and consistently delivering solutions, giving advice and actioning various UX/UI design tasks and decisions throughout the product.
- Running various workshops with Peel and JB DAO teams to ensure alignment, brainstorm ideas and create prioritised visions for the future of the product.

**Over the next 4 funding cycles I would like to focus on:**

- Redesign an optimised version of the homepage based on user behaviour, data and feedback with a focus on project discovery and conversion rate optimisation.
- Complete all iterations and ensure create flow is optimised and usable
- Continue to design for improved project discovery, including a redesign and optimisation of the Explore Projects page.
- Create a style guide for developer reference
- Action various UX/UI design tasks when they pop up.
- Conduct monthly user interviews or testing sessions, gathering feedback and insights to ensure we are staying on track and delivering a usable product.
- Dive deeper into the analytics & data with ARCx and hotjar to continue to push for better conversion rates and user satisfaction.
- If time allows begin redesign and optimisation of the Project Page based on user data and feedback to build more trust and drive more contributions.

I am confident in my ability to deliver on this and execute the list of priorities outlined above. Pending unforeseen interruptions and focus changes some items on the list may be pushed back until the next proposal. Really looking forward to continuing my work within the Peel team. 

## **Risks**

- I don’t deliver enough meaningful work during this period

## **Timeline**

Starting at Peel V3 FC#3 and continuing for 4 Funding cycles (until JuiceboxDAO **~FC#41**).

## Notes

- Remove strathmckay.eth payout after Peel V3 FC#2
- Add payout to naisho.eth for US$3800 starting from Peel V3 FC#4
