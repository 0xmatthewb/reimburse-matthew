## Summary

Bring Wraeth on as a core team member.

## Rationale

Since joining Peel and Juicebox, Wraeth has got up to speed very quickly. He's delivered numerous non-trivial features, and has given many high-quality code reviews.
I am confident in Wraeth's ability to assess code contributions with the health of the app in mind.

Wraeth would be a great addition to the core team.
