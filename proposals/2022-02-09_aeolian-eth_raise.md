Proposal: increase my payout from $1500 to $2500 per FC.

To keep it short, I think my value has probably become clear by now. I want to continue shaping the rollout plan for V2, as well as helping where I can with general frontend/design/planning work. I also want to note that I am eager, willing and able to take on more responsibilities should the DAO need it.

In full transparency, I am not full-time on Juicebox yet, but hope you feel my contributions across Peel and Juicebox justify this proposal. Critical feedback welcome and encouraged - let me know how I can do better (DMs are open).
