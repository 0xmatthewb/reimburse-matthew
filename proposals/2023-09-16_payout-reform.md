### 3. Reduction requests

Anyone can request a reduction to any individuals payout at any time, including the individual themselves.

Guiding principles for reduction requests:
- They should be as objective as possible.
- They should be in response to a contributor not being able to fulfill their responsibilities.
- They are unemotional and not personal.
- They are not necessarily permanent.

### 4. Contributor freeze

No new contributors for the duration of this proposal. Exception: if a contributor's capacity is reduced such that the team will lack in the
 given function, then a new contributor may be onboarded to fill the gap.

## Timeline

Execute immediately. This proposal will last for the duration of Peel's JBDAO payout passed in gov cycle 57.
