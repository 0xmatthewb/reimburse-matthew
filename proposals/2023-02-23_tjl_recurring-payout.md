## Proposal date

February 23nd 2023

## Thesis

I am proposing that I enter a recurring payout of USD$2650 in ETH per funding cycle as a Product Owner with the Peel core team to take the Juicebox product(s) to the next level, coordinating a product roadmap, projects, and the implementation of product-based marketing. 

## Motivation

Juicebox is currently in a unique position, with limited runway left and a relatively undefined future for the product. I have demonstrated the ability to quickly grasp the protocol, DAO space, and the combined vision of the wider team to pull together a comprehensive product framework. With my contribution to Juicebox, I am confident that I can add an additional product strategy layer and coordinate the product team (Peel) to execute a well-defined roadmap so we begin to see further product traction.

I bring a unique skill set and wealth of experience in product management, design, growth, and product marketing to the team, to create comprehensive product operations, in a time that needs them the most.

I’m committed to continuing to collaborate with Peel and the wider JBDAO team to take us out of the weeds within a small niche and expose Juicebox to new opportunities, growth and verticals so we can turn this ship around and continue our vision to enable the creators of tomorrow to launch, fund and manage the **boldest** projects on the internet.

I will do this by:

- Tightening collaboration efforts toward a single mission and set of goals/milestones;
- Defining, scoping, and delivering upon various meaningful projects as outlined in the product roadmap;
- Introducing product marketing principles to engage our users and community in a more impactful way;
- Creating a product culture of shipping fast and frequent;
- Coordinating research, design, development and marketing efforts at the feature/project level.

## Specification

Provide $2650USD in ETH per funding cycle as compensation to timjl.eth for the duration of Peels next JBDAO payout period in return for product management and growth efforts.

## Rationale

During my trial period of 2 FC’s, I contributed to the Juicebox product and strategy in the following ways:

- Facilitating a team-wide two-part workshop to consolidate and capture product intentions: [https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPn3ZiMg=/?share_link_id=182658138734](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPn3ZiMg=/?share_link_id=182658138734);
- Creation of the Juicebox product framework defining a clear vision, mission, goals, and high-level roadmap to work toward: [https://www.notion.so/Product-framework-dc8da04f5b7e4197bd27ebbf5fa43e9b?pvs=](https://www.notion.so/Product-framework-dc8da04f5b7e4197bd27ebbf5fa43e9b);
- Introduction of the RICE prioritization system and project management board updates: [https://github.com/orgs/jbx-protocol/projects/1](https://github.com/orgs/jbx-protocol/projects/1);
- Beginnings of a sales playbook in collaboration with FilipV & StevieG to clearly articulate inbound and outbound sales strategies and begin scaling efforts: [https://www.notion.so/Sales-framework-4599282c98034be7ba1c824bec278823?pvs=4](https://www.notion.so/Sales-framework-4599282c98034be7ba1c824bec278823);
- Various product design support with @Strath spanning across project creation flow, project page and NFT’s;
- More importantly, I delivered upon the agreed items as outlined in phase 1 of my proposal which was the premise of my trial: [https://grand-popcorn-c81.notion.site/Peel-Product-Framework-3a1790bf75c3439e84bd4188ad440cf0](https://www.notion.so/Peel-Product-Framework-3a1790bf75c3439e84bd4188ad440cf0)
    - Building a product framework and strategy;
    - Introducing task prioritization;
    - Cleaning up, grooming, and managing the task board(s).

From here on out, the major tasks I’ll be looking to deliver will be:

- Clearly defining the sales playbook to scale and measure inbound and outbound efforts;
- Setting up a beta testing program to engage usability testing and interview participants with ease and increase engagement with our community;
- Expanding the product into new revenue-generating opportunity verticals and features;
- Further scoping, management, and delivery of the roadmap items as outlined in the product framework;
- Introduction and management of product marketing channels such as feature release comms and product update coordination efforts.

I am confident in my ability to deliver on this and execute the proposed framework and roadmap. I believe I can add immense value to Juicebox within a short period of time and really looking forward to working with such a talented and passionate team to take JB to new heights.

## Risks

- I don’t deliver enough work during this period in accordance with your expectations
- I don’t live up to your expectations
- The team pushes back on collaboration efforts

## Timeline

Starting at Peel FC#8 and continuing for the duration of Peels next JBDAO payout period.
