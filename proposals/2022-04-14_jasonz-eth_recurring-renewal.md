PROPOSAL  @Peeler (core team)  Hey y'all, following with Johnny's proposal, also want to submit the proposal to renew my recurring payouts (JZ) - US$1.5K per funding cycle (week)

Case
- I've been consistently deliverying UX contribution via - V2 design for project creation & project details page (though some of them are canned, but hopefully still useful thinking exercise and can be picked up later ðŸ˜‚), UI feedback & ideation for incremental improvements, customer research/interviews, ideate NFT related work with tank;
- I'm absolutely loving working with you guys here and believe in juicebox's future, thus want to continue the contribution. (hopefully become full time one day in future!)

Risks
JZ slacking and not providing enough design work - if you observe this happen on me, please let me know!

Lastly just want to thank you the team, you have been making juicebox an amazing place to work and i really hope can get the chance to continue working with you all!
