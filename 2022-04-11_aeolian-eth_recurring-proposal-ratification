üçå  PROPOSAL: require payouts and reserved token allocation to be reassessed every 10 funding cycles.

To ensure payouts to contributors continue to reflect their value to Peel, I propose we ratify our payout process slightly to require payouts to be reassessed every 10 funding cycles.

This means contributors recieving a payout must create a new proposal for their payout every 10 funding cycles. For example, my last payout adjust started in FC#7. In FC#17, I would have to propose to stay on the payouts list (at the same/increased/decreased payout amount depending on circumstances).

If this proposal passes, I will define the above in our Notion.
