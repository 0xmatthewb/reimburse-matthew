Proposal

Payout trial period: @jmill  $1000 per week @ ~10 hours of work per week
Trial Period duration: 1 week.

Links to all landed PRs: https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/commits?author=jmilldotdev
Discord Discussion: Been involved with the design of the veBanny/NFT staking feature, and had a bit of hand in contract work.

How you plan to contribute going forward
- Time expectation: I am splitting my time between this and other projects, but generally if i can work at a rate of ~$100/hr i am happy.
- Code contribution: 
    - UI cleanup, veBanny/NFT staking feature lead engineer, other projects in the pipeline (especially interested in integrating the subgraphs with the frontend!)
    - Don't mind working on bug fixes, or full blown features. 
- Governance: Find it hard to give the time that i need to governance since i stay pretty busy between code and IRL stuff, but definitely keeping an ear open.
- I submitted a 1 week trial period since i feel i have already proved myself between shipping the veBanny frontend draft and the dozen+ PRs in the v2 launch sprint
