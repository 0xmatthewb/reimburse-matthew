- I feel responsible for site reliability.
  - the translations broke and I had to investigate the fix. https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/1036

  - I've queued all of Peel's multisig transactions (outside of infra expenses).
  - I wrote our hiring guide.
- I've been a spokesperson for Peel, giving progress reports in the JB townhall, as well as on Discord where needed.
- I frequently get pinged in the JB Discord to attend to bugs, support requests, and other frontend-related discussion.

#### Product responsibility

  - the homepage make over (new copy, small layout improvements, etc.
