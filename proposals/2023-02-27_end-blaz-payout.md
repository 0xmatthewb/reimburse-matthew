# **End Blaz recurring payout**

## **Proposal date:**

February 27th 2023

## **Motivation**

Moving forward, I will be allocating all of my time to JokeDAO and Defifa. Therefore, I do not want Peel DAO to suffer even for a minute.

## **End note**

Firstly, I would like to express my appreciation to everyone at Peel for the tremendous support, respect, and love that you have shown me. Peel has provided me with an excellent opportunity to grow as a programmer and as an individual, and I am grateful for the last 7 months that I have spent here.

During my time at Peel DAO, you have supported me in many ways, starting with giving me a chance to contribute when there seemed to be little room for me. Over time, I have gained your respect and trust, and I believe that we have formed a great relationship. I would like to keep that relationship going, even though I will now be moving on to other projects.

I have no doubt that you have assembled an excellent team at Peel, and I know that you will continue to rock the ship just as you have done until now. Moving forward, I will still be lurking around on your discord to cheer you on with every win!

Thank you again for everything, and I wish you all the best.

With love,
Blaz
