Proposal date:
21 November 2022

Motivation
I feel that I have not been leading any initiatives at Peel as of late, and that there is not enough work for me to do to justify a full-time salary for myself.

I am also going to be quite busy with several other projects during the fall and winter and intend to dedicate more time to those things.

Rationale
I feel I was a strong contributor while I was working on veNFT and the Settings Page, but as of late I feel my contributions have not been as valuable and that I do not have a major project to lead.

I had been trying to do the DB and user session stuff, but it didn't feel like something that would make or break the JBM app and also felt slightly out of my technical ability.

Specification
End jmill payout. jmill will refund the DAO the last ETH payment made, plus any additional payments distributed while this proposal is being decided on.

jmill will remain a multisig signer.

jmill will document and handoff all work in progress on things like user verification & sessions, project bookmarking, and twitter verification.
