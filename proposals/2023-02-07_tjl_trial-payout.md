## Proposal date

February 6, 2023


## Thesis

I am proposing that I enter a trial period as a product owner & designer working closely with Peel to set the product vision, maintain the roadmap, manage the day-to-day product team tasks as well as support any UX/UI design efforts, so we can work on meaningful projects and see product growth. I propose that the trial period last two funding cycles (FC#6 & FC#7) and that I receive a payout of $600USD in ETH per funding cycle.

## Motivation

Juicebox has built an incredible product, pulled together a talented team, and has built a fantastic community, but from my research and observations, there may be a few challenges including: 

1. A high number of user and internal requests create reactive development efforts
2. Missing of larger product strategy and overall alignment inhibiting the bottom line and meaningful business metrics
3. Free for all contribution environment creates siloed efforts, resulting in patchy product development

To position Juicebox into a more intentional position, and allow the team to continue to work on the most impactful tasks, it will require a dedicated product owner to collaborate with the wider team, take ownership of project management, implement processes, and grow the product, so we can:

- Manage and track efforts
- Build out the future of Juicebox
- Keep track of issues, feedback, and bugs

## Specification

Provide US$600 in ETH per funding cycle as compensation to timjl.eth for two funding cycles in return for epic product management and product growth contributions.

## Rationale

I feel I can add an additional layer to Peel/Juicebox to run help a tighter shop and see more frequent wins and growth by optimizing product and management areas within the team.

My background as a product designer, product marketer, and head of product, gives me a unique approach to products that can see the whole picture from high-level strategies, to low-level tasks. This means I can help optimize the processes and future of Juicebox with product management, growth strategies, and team alignment of roadmap/direction.

I have spent the last few weeks learning how the team works, the nuances of the operation, and how the platform works. I have taken the time to understand the end-users, the contributors, and the current working styles and I have put together a proposal on some immediate changes I would make to our product management framework, as well as a phased implementation plan and the activities I’ll undertake throughout. This can be found here:

Within a short period, I have discovered many ways in which I can add efficiencies and value within the team to grow and manage the product and team.

Over the next few weeks, I’d love the opportunity to prove my worth and would like to start by implementing some of the proposed changes as outlined in my proposal, as well as help oversee and support the UX/UI side of things and facilitate the growth of the product.

## Risks

- The value may not be recognized as quickly as two weeks
- The team may reject new changes/processes

## Timeline

Two funding cycles duration, starting at FC#6.
