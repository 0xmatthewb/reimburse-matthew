It's also time for Peel to renew our recurring payout proposal to JBDao

The responsibilities from our initial proposal still feel on point to me:
- Maintaining any and all frontend-related work on juicebox.money, rinkeby.juicebox.money, and all related Juicebox interfaces.
- Design & implement a frontend experience based on changes to the JB protocol (such as V2).
- Research & deliver customer insights.
- Manage juicebox.money domain.

Our budget leaves $2,285/wk for funding the multisig, which so far has solidly covered infra expenses. Our current treasury (2.1 ETH) should be enough to cover any unexpected spikes in operating costs, and that amount will continue growing until spending increases.

My only thought is that it might be nice to have some extra treasury funds for one-off purchases (like buying assets or sponsoring a hackathon), but if it's something that aligns with JB, I'd be cool with trying to fund it through the JB treasury or requesting a payout if time allows.

Overall our budget and outline of responsibilities still feels solid, and I'd be cool with re-submitting for a renewal
